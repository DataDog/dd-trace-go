        Configuration key for setting custom <em>span</em> sampling rules based on glob patterns.
        Comma separated list of span sampling rules.
        The rule is matched in order of specification. The first match in a list is used.
        The supported glob pattern characters are '*' and '?'.
        A '*' matches any contiguous substring.
        A '?' matches exactly one character.

        Per entry:
            The item "service" is a glob pattern string, to match on the service name.
                Optional and defaults to '*'.
            The item "name" is a glob pattern string, to match on the operation name.
                Optional and defaults to '*'.
            The item "sample_rate" is a float and is the probability of keeping a matched span.
                Optional and defaults to 1.0 (keep all).
            The item "max_per_second" is a float and is the maximum number of spans that can be kept per second for the rule.
                Optional and defaults to unlimited.

        Examples:
        Match all spans that have a service name of "cart" and an operation name of "checkout" with a kept limit of 1000 per second.
            "[{"service": "cart", "name": "checkout", "max_per_second": 1000}]"

        Match 50% of spans that have a service name of "cart" and an operation name of "checkout" with a kept limit of 1000 per second.
            "[{"service": "cart", "name": "checkout", "sample_rate": 0.5, "max_per_second": 1000}]"

        Match all spans that start with "cart" without any limits and any operation name.

        **Description**: A comma-separated list of baggage keys that are automatically applied as span tags to the local root span. For example, a baggage key user.id is tagged as baggage.user.id

        This feature only applies to baggage extracted from incoming HTTP headers. Baggage set with the baggage API is not included.
         - To tag all baggage items, set the value to *. Use this with caution to avoid exposing sensitive data in tags.

        Per entry:

          The item "service" is optional in regular expression format, to match on service name.
          The item "name" is optional in regular expression format, to match on operation name.

        To give a rate of 50% to any traces in a service starting with the text "cart":
          '[{"sample_rate":0.5, "service":"cart.*"}]'

        To give a rate of 20% to any traces which have an operation name of "http.request":
          '[{"sample_rate":0.2, "name":"http.request"}]'

        To give a rate of 100% to any traces within a service named "background" and with an operation name of "sql.query":
          '[{"sample_rate":1.0, "service":"background", "name":"sql.query"}]

        To give a rate of 10% to all traces

Defined by a JSON array of objects, where each object must include a sample_rate between 0.0 and 1.0 (inclusive), and can optionally include fields such as service, name, resource, tags, and max_per_second. Objects are evaluated in the order listed; the first matching object determines the trace's sample rate. For more information, see Ingestion Mechanisms.

        OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER & OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG
        : **Datadog convention**: DD_TRACE_SAMPLE_RATE

        OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER: Sampler to be used for traces & OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG: String value to be used as the sampler argument

        **Notes**: The specified value is only used if OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER is set. Each Sampler type defines its own expected input, if any. Invalid or unrecognized input MUST be logged and MUST be otherwise ignored. In such cases, the implementation MUST behave as if OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG is not set

        Mapped values between OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER & DD_TRACE_SAMPLE_RATE:

         - parentbased_always_on|1.0
         - parentbased_always_off|0.0
         - parentbased_traceidratio|${OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG}
         - always_on|1.0
         - always_off|0.0
         - traceidratio|${OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG}
