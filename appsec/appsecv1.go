// TrackUserLoginSuccessEvent sets a successful user login event, with the given
// user id and optional metadata, as service entry span tags. It also calls
// SetUser() to set the currently authenticated user, along with the given
// tracer.UserMonitoringOption options. As documented in SetUser(), an
// error is returned when the given user ID is blocked by your denylist. Cf.
// SetUser()'s documentation for more details.
// The service entry span is obtained through the given Go context which should
// contain the currently running span. This function does nothing when no span
// is found in the given Go context and logs an error message instead.
// Such events trigger the backend-side events monitoring, such as the Account
// Take-Over (ATO) monitoring, ultimately blocking the IP address and/or user id
// associated to them.
//
// Deprecated: use [TrackUserLoginSuccess] instead. It requires collection of
// the user login, which is useful for detecting account takeover attacks.
