// The purpose of the packages held in contrib is to provide tracing on top of commonly used
// packages from the standard library as well as the community in a "plug-and-play" manner.
// This means that by simply importing the appropriate path, functions are exposed having
// the same signature as the original package. These functions return structures that embed
// the original return value, allowing  them to be used as they normally would with tracing
// activated out of the box.

// All of these libraries are supported by our [APM product](https://www.datadoghq.com/apm/).
