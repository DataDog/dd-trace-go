aspects:
  # TODO(human): Implement the aspect to intercept kgo.NewClient calls.
  #
  # The aspect should:
  # 1. Have a join-point matching function calls to kgo.NewClient
  # 2. Use advice to wrap the call with our instrumented version
  #
  # Hints:
  # - Look at how segmentio/kafka-go handles NewReader in its orchestrion.yml
  # - Your NewClient signature: NewClient(kgoOpts []kgo.Opt, tracingOpts ...tracing.Option) (*Client, error)
  # - ClientOptions(opts ...kgo.Opt) []kgo.Opt converts variadic to slice
  # - The tracing package path is: github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-go/contrib/twmb/franz-go/v2/internal/tracing
