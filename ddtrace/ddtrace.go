// Additionally, package "ext" provides a set of tag names and values specific to Datadog's APM product.

// SpanContext represents a span state that can propagate to descendant spans
// and across process boundaries. It contains all the information needed to
// spawn a direct descendant of the span that it belongs to. It can be used
// to create distributed tracing by propagating it using the provided interfaces.

	// SpanID returns the span ID that this context is carrying.
