## Orchestrion Integration Tests

This package contains integration tests that are executed using [`orchestrion`][1]. They are not
expected to pass unless they are built with [`orchestrion`][1].

The test binaries are built with all compile-time integrations activated (see
[`orchestrion.tool.go`][2]).

This test suite is run in CI as part of the [orchestrion.yml][6] workflow.

### Prerequisites

#### Docker

This test suite uses [`testcontainers`][3] to provide endpoints for certain tests (Redis, Cassandra,
etc...). These are currently un-supported by Windows and macOS runners on GitHub Actions, and are
omitted when the `githubci` build tag is present.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Running on macOS with <tt>colima</tt>
</summary>

Running the test suite locally on a macOS host that uses [`colima`][4] as a container engine may
require executing the following commands so that [`testcontainers`][3] correctly leverages it:

```console
$ export DOCKER_HOST=$(docker context inspect "$(docker context show)" -f "{{ .Endpoints.docker.Host }}")
$ export TESTCONTAINERS_DOCKER_SOCKET_OVERRIDE='/var/run/docker.sock'
```

</details>

#### Python

In order to validate side-effects injected by compile-time instrumentation, this test suite uses the
[`dd-apm-test-agent`][5] package. If the `ddapm-test-agent` binary can be resolved from `$PATH`, it
will be used as-is (resulting in faster overall execution times); otherwise, a Python virtual
environment will be created at the start of each test.

You can install the `ddapm-test-agent` program using the following command:
```console
$ pip install -r internal/agent/requirements-dev.txt
```
