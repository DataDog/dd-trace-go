// Importing "github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-go/v2/orchestrion/all" in an
// `orchestrion.tool.go` file causes the package to use _all_ available
// integrations of `dd-trace-go`.
// This makes it easy to ensure all available features of DataDog are enabled in
// your go application, but may cause your dependency closure (`go.mod` and
// `go.sum` files) to include a lot more packages than are stricly necessary for
// your application. If that is a problem, you should instead manually import
// only the specific integrations that are useful to your application.
