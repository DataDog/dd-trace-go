    # We're not using the cache feature provided by setup-go so that we can
    # also cache the gotestsum install below. This can save up to 60s of CI
    # time. It's not entirely clear why the gotestsum install step is slow
    # sometimes, but from my debugging it seems hanging on some Off-CPU,
    # perhaps network activity occasionally.
