### Datadog Client Libraries for Go

This repository contains Go packages for the client-side components of the Datadog product suite for Application Performance Monitoring, Continuous Profiling and Application Security Monitoring of Go applications.

- [Datadog Application Performance Monitoring (APM)](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/): Trace requests as they flow across web servers, databases and microservices so that developers have great visiblity into bottlenecks and troublesome requests.
The package [`gopkg.in/DataDog/dd-trace-go.v1/ddtrace/tracer`](https://pkg.go.dev/gopkg.in/DataDog/dd-trace-go.v1/ddtrace/tracer) allows you to trace any piece of your Go code, and commonly used Go libraries can be automatically traced thanks to our out-of-the-box integrations which can be found in the package [`gopkg.in/DataDog/dd-trace-go.v1/ddtrace/contrib`](https://pkg.go.dev/gopkg.in/DataDog/dd-trace-go.v1/contrib).

- [Datadog Go Continuous Profiler](https://docs.datadoghq.com/profiler/): Continuously profile your Go apps to find CPU, memory, and synchronization bottlenecks, broken down by function name, and line number, to significantly reduce end-user latency and infrastructure costs.
The package [`gopkg.in/DataDog/dd-trace-go.v1/profiler`](https://pkg.go.dev/gopkg.in/DataDog/dd-trace-go.v1/profiler) allows you to periodically collect and send Go profiles to the Datadog API.

- [Datadog Application Security Management (ASM)](https://docs.datadoghq.com/security_platform/application_security/) provides in-app monitoring and protection against application-level attacks that aim to exploit code-level vulnerabilities, such as a Server-Side-Request-Forgery (SSRF), a SQL injection (SQLi), or Reflected Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS). ASM identifies services exposed to application attacks and leverages in-app security rules to detect and protect against threats in your application environment. ASM is not a standalone Go package and is transparently integrated into the APM tracer. You can simply enable it with [`DD_APPSEC_ENABLED=true`](https://docs.datadoghq.com/security/application_security/enabling/go).

### Installing

This module contains many packages, but most users should probably install the two packages below:

```bash
go get gopkg.in/DataDog/dd-trace-go.v1/ddtrace/tracer
go get gopkg.in/DataDog/dd-trace-go.v1/profiler
```

Additionally there are many [contrib](./contrib) packages that can be installed to automatically instrument and trace commonly used Go libraries such as [net/http](https://pkg.go.dev/gopkg.in/DataDog/dd-trace-go.v1/contrib/net/http), [gorilla/mux](https://pkg.go.dev/gopkg.in/DataDog/dd-trace-go.v1/contrib/gorilla/mux) or [database/sql](https://pkg.go.dev/gopkg.in/DataDog/dd-trace-go.v1/contrib/database/sql):

```
go get gopkg.in/DataDog/dd-trace-go.v1/contrib/gorilla/mux
```

If you installed more packages than you intended, you can use `go mod tidy` to remove any unused packages.

### Documentation

 - [APM Tracing API](https://pkg.go.dev/gopkg.in/DataDog/dd-trace-go.v1/ddtrace)
 - [APM Tracing Go Applications](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/setup/go/)
 - [Continuous Go Profiler](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/profiler/enabling/go)
 - [Application Security Monitoring](https://docs.datadoghq.com/security_platform/application_security/setup_and_configure/?code-lang=go)
 - If you are migrating from an older version of the tracer (e.g. 0.6.x) you may also find the [migration document](MIGRATING.md) we've put together helpful.

### Go Support Policy

Datadog APM for Go is built upon dependencies defined in specific versions of the host operating system, Go releases, and the Datadog Agent/API. dd-trace-go supports the two latest releases of Go, matching the [official Go policy](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#policy). This library only officially supports [first class ports](https://go.dev/wiki/PortingPolicy) of Go.

### Contributing

Before considering contributions to the project, please take a moment to read our brief [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Testing

Tests can be run locally using the Go toolset. The grpc.v12 integration will fail (and this is normal), because it covers for deprecated methods. In the CI environment
we vendor this version of the library inside the integration. Under normal circumstances this is not something that we want to do, because users using this integration
might be running versions different from the vendored one, creating hard to debug conflicts.

To run integration tests locally, you should set the `INTEGRATION` environment variable. The dependencies of the integration tests are best run via Docker. To get an
idea about the versions and the set-up take a look at our [docker-compose config](./docker-compose.yaml).

The best way to run the entire test suite is using the [test.sh](./test.sh) script. You'll need Docker and docker-compose installed. If this is your first time running the tests, you should run `./test.sh -t` to install any missing test tools/dependencies. Run `./test.sh --all` to run all of the integration tests through the docker-compose environment. Run `./test.sh --help` for more options.

If you're only interested in the tests for a specific integration it can be useful to spin up just the required containers via docker-compose.
For example if you're running tests that need the `mysql` database container to be up:
```shell
docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml -p dd-trace-go up -d mysql
```
